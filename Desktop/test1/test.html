     <p class="center" id="tribute-info">Maya, Mesoamerican Indians occupying a nearly continuous territory in southern Mexico, Guatemala, and northern Belize.
        <p> In the early 21st century some 30 Mayan languages were spoken by more than five million people, most of whom were bilingual in Spanish.</p> <p>Before the Spanish conquest of Mexico and Central America, the Maya possessed one of the greatest civilizations of the Western Hemisphere They practiced agriculture,</p><p>built great stone buildings and pyramid temples, worked gold and copper, and used a form of hieroglyphic writing that has now largely been deciphered.</p>
     <p class="center">As early as 1500 bce the Maya had settled in villages and had developed an agriculture based on the cultivation of corn (maize), beans, and squash;</p><p> by 600 ce cassava (sweet manioc) was also grown. (See also origins of agriculture: Early development: The Americas.) </p><p>They began to build ceremonial centres, and by 200 ce these had developed into cities containing temples, pyramids, palaces, courts for playing ball, and plazas.</p><p>The ancient Maya quarried immense quantities of building stone (usually limestone), which they cut by using harder stones such as chert.</p><p> They practiced mainly slash-and-burn agriculture, but they used advanced techniques of irrigation and terracing.</p><p>They also developed a system of hieroglyphic writing and highly sophisticated calendrical and astronomical systems.</p><p> The Maya made paper from the inner bark of wild fig trees and wrote their hieroglyphs on books made from this paper.</p><p> Those books are called codices. The Maya also developed an elaborate and beautiful tradition of sculpture and relief carving. </p><p>Architectural works and stone inscriptions and reliefs are the chief sources of knowledge about the early Maya. Early Mayan culture showed the influence of the earlier Olmec civilization.</p>
